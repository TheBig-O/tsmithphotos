title: Rainy Weekend in California
location: San Francisco, California
---

Went to California on business, ended up staying over the weekend to hang around
San Francisco a bit. Unfortunately it poured rain the whole time so the Nikon
got limited exposure. But I did manage to capture the immense pride of a sea
lion who launched his competition off the pier so he could be king of his little
barge, if only for a moment.

Schlepping my Nikon and handful of lenses all the way out there to have to leave
them in the hotel room most of the weekend was quite a bummer. I'm starting to
feel a need for a smaller camera for trips like this. Something portable that I
could shield from weather or pack along without dedicating half a backpack to.
