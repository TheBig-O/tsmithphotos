I love my Nikon D7000. I really do. But
[last weekend's rain]({% post_url 2016-03-13-PAARSFOC %}) was a real downer.
Though I'd rather pack my camera along and not use it, I hate packing it along
and then being _forced_ to leave it in the hotel room. In truth, it's never been
easy lugging it around with a backpack full of glass on business trips or little
social events anyway. Watching Charlie's
[Fuji X100T](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x100t/)
that weekend or Matt's [Fuji X-E1](http://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_e1/)
in [Barcelona]({% post_url 2015-09-14-WCGS %}) made me a little jealous. These
were capable cameras that were pocket-able and didn't take much packing space.

Last time I went into Precision Camera "just to look around," I walked out with
that Nikon D7000 from the used department. Today, I walked out with a used X-E1
and [18-55mm](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/). Oops.
