This was my third year attending the San Diego Drupal Camp, the second as a
presenter. We've got two employees out in San Diego now, and it's always a good
time to see them. Four Kitchens usually sends over a good handful of Web Chefs
and we all take a few extra days to have some local fun like sailing with Matt
and his father.
