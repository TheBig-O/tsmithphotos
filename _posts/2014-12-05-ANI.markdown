Oklahoma is known for its bad weather, there's a [whole song about
it](https://youtu.be/ZbrnXl2gO_k?t=48s) which is coincidentally the State Song.
And such was the fate of my evening. All Tulsa and Oklahoma City area airports
closed due to low, heavy fog. Friends tell me visibility on the ground was even
unsafe for driving. But my flight out of Austin had already pushed back when I
got word, so I was offered the opportunity to sleep in the concourse at the
[George Bush Intercontinental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport)
Airport in north Houston.

Generally teeming with travelers from all over the world, this is one of the
busiest places I find myself on a regular basis. But I was surprised: even this
airport slows down late at night. Without the passengers, IAH becomes an
abandoned but clean, luminous expanse of curious architecture, repetitive
furniture, and hauntingly wide spaces.

FitBit indicates that I walked twelve miles between 9pm and 3am. As I ran out of
energy, I happened upon a group of other stranded travelers in the B South
Concourse where we played cards and talked about our adventures. Two sisters
from Mexico traveling from a mission trip in Tel Aviv, a newlywed Canadian
couple headed to South America, and a violin-playing Californian exchange
student en route from France. We watched the sunrise together, then flew off in
different directions.
