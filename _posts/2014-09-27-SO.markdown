We have a client, [World Pulse](https://www.worldpulse.com/en), in Portland,
Oregon. I was invited to join them for their annual event _World Pulse LIVE_ to
meet more of their staff, community contributors, and the graduates of the
Voices of Our Future program. I am inspired by the work this organization does
and empowers in others, and I feel so privileged to have worked with them as
they push for real change in developing areas.

After their event, my project manager returned home and I rented a car and drove
out to US 101 along the coast for hiking on Saturday and Sunday before taking a
redeye back to Austin to be back in the office on Monday morning.
