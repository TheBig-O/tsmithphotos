This was my third year as Stage Manager for
[River City Pops](http://www.rivercitypops.org). I've always enjoyed shooting
the backstage adventures in theatre because it combines so many of my interests
while showing people a side of live performance that many are unfamiliar with.
I didn't get as many photos this year because I had more going on during the
show and only carried my cameras to one performance day.
