Congratulations to my friend Alyssa for _killin' it_ at her senior recital in
Boulder this weekend. A small group of us arrived Friday night and headed out
Sunday morning, leaving a lot to pack into a single day, including a return
to the Rocky Mountain National Park where we headed up the Tundra Communities
Trail (because Tyler wanted to see the top of a mountain for the first time,
and this was the best place I knew how to get to) and Sprague Lake, which is
surprisingly beautiful and out of the way. I think the views are better than
the nearby Bear Lake, which is usually packed.
