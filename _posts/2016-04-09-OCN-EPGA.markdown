location: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

A talented friend of mine played Jimmy in OU Musical Theatre's production of
_Thoroughly Modern Millie_ over the weekend and this was my last chance to see
him in a show before he graduates this May. Despite living in Tulsa for about 8
years, I've never been to Oklahoma City, so George and Evan drove over from
Tulsa and we did a little sightseeing before showtime.

We started the day by checking out a dozen old VW buses that Evan had his eye
on, then wandered through the [Botanical Gardens at Myriad
Park](http://oklahomacitybotanicalgardens.com/), visited the Murrah Federal
Building memorial, and finally checked out the new
["Skydance Bridge"](http://www.visitokc.com/about-okc/skydance-bridge/).

The bridge design is inspired by the movement of the scissor-tail, Oklahoma's
state bird, and is lit by
[Philips Color Kinetics](http://www.colorkinetics.com/showcase/installs/Skydance-Bridge/)
fixtures that I've used in shows before. Unfortunately, while the bridge is
cool, we learned that it goes
[from nowhere to nowhere else](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Skydance+Pedestrian+Bridge,+Oklahoma+City,+OK+73109/@35.4564231,-97.5196303,17z)
over Interstate 40. Maybe there will be parks or buildings at each end one day.
