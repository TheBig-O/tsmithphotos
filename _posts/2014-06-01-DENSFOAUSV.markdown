I took a week's vacation but couldn't figure out where to go, so I decided to go
everywhere. I flew to Denver on a Sunday night and drove up to Winter Park for
hiking in the Rocky Mountain National Park. Then I flew over to San Francisco to
visit friends, which included a walk from the east end of the Embarcadero to the
far end of the Golden Gate Bridge

That weekend, I flew to Austin for a company retreat weekend, and returned to
Tulsa the following Monday morning.
