title: In search of Scotch and the Loch Ness Monster
location: Scotland / Dublin, Ireland

Alex and I grew up next door to each other and will simplify introductions by
calling each other siblings. And in truth, I was part-time adopted by her
family, which led to developing an interest in programming and technology. They
had high-speed internet!

Itching to get out of town and go on an epic adventure this spring, we opened up
Google Maps and started pointing at options. We settled on a tour of Scotland,
but after researching flights, we discovered for slightly _less_ money, we could
also pull off a weekend in Dublin by flying there to/from the US and catching
European economy carriers between Dublin and Edinburgh.

## So, about the dinosaurs

A friend of mind found a post online, ["Travel photos are instantly better with
Dinosaur toys"](http://imgur.com/gallery/6Faib). Alex thought it was a
tremendous idea, so we went out and gathered some companions for the journey.
Her photos of the dinosaurs are better than mine, though. I suppose the
surrealism in the shared post could also be achieved with some aggressive
Photoshop work, which I did not do.

We did learn that camera phones are surprisingly competent at this task. The
dinosaur photos work best when the toy and the background are both in-focus
because it makes them look like they're on the same scale. With such small
sensors, the camera phone apertures are smaller, yielding a deeper depth of
field. My usual macro / narrow-depth-of-field style for objects and animals with
my SLR separates them from the background.

So after what seemed like hours of trying to get the composition and field
correctly set to get what I want, I landed on using my Nexus 5X's built-in
camera or the fisheye lens on the Nikon for the better shots. It was a fun
travel challenge.

### Scotland

#### AUS --> IAD --> DUB --> EDI

We flew overnight from Austin and made it to Edinburgh by the next afternoon.
After a paperwork debacle at the rental car station, we ended up with a free
upgrade to a [Peugeot 2008](http://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/peugeot/2008) and
made our way into downtown to the
[Kick Ass Hostel](https://kickasshostels.co.uk/) and explored the city that
evening.

#### [Cairngorms National Park](http://cairngorms.co.uk/), [RZSS Highland Wildlife Park](http://www.highlandwildlifepark.org.uk/), and Craigellachie ("creg-AL-eh-hee")

The national park service of Scotland is actually quite new; this is the second
park of its kind and was established in 2003. We drove through it on the way up
from Edinburgh to Craigellachie and made a few stops to wander around.

Craigellachie is a quaint little town along the river Spey: the river from which
most highland Scotch flows. There's whisky in that river! We toured The
Macallan Distillery, a family favorite, but Craigellachie, Glenfiddich,
Aberlour, and The Balvenie were all within a few miles.

The next morning, we drove back to the Wildlife Park in the Cairngorms. It has a
long walking trail along large habitats and a drive loop through a few more
around the edge of the park.

#### Drumnadrochit, Loch Ness, and the Urquhart Castle

On our way from Highland Scotch paradise over to our next destination on the
Isle of Skye, we felt compelled to make a stop at Loch Ness. Approaching the
town of Drumnadrochit, the tourism industry is outlandishly self-evident. We
arrived after the castle ruins closed, so we took a few dinosaur photos from the
overlook before heading on.

@TODO: You should finish this.

## Dublin
