location: Austin, Texas

Back to the hillside for my fifth show with [Zilker Theatre
Productions](http://www.zilker.org), _Shrek the Musical._ This is the
first time I've ever lugged my camera out there, but I'm glad I
did. The backstage shenanigans of the Hillside never disappoint.

It's been a great summer with all of you. Thank you for a great show.
