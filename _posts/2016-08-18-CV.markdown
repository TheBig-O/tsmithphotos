title: Colorado Birthday Getaway
location: Grand Lake, Colorado

To celebrate the end of [Shrek]({% post_url 2016-08-01-SB %}) and also
my birthday, I disappeared up into the mountains for a few days at an
old family haunt. My family used to have reunions near the Rocky
Mountain National Park in the YMCA Snow Mountain Ranch for a week
every summer, all 15 of us.

Over the years, I got to know the area pretty well, so
on this trip we hit up all my favorites:
[Cascade Falls](http://www.rockymountainhikingtrails.com/cascade-falls.htm)
_(which we bouldered all the way down!)_,
[Alberta Falls](http://www.rockymountainhikingtrails.com/alberta-falls.htm)
_(which was deserted due to weather, yay!)_,
[Adams Falls](http://www.rockymountainhikingtrails.com/adams-falls.htm)
_(which in all these years I still haven't captured in a photo I like)_,
the lakes off the Glacier Gorge trailhead, and kickin' around Grand
Lake.

I played with long exposures of waterfalls more than I have in the
past. I'd brought along a couple neutral density filters that ended up
being pretty hazy, so I just waited for shade and used a small
aperture and cleaned up the lingering overexposure in Lightroom. Oh
well, lessons for next time.

We also spent a little time above the treeline on Trail Ridge Road in
the park so I could get some night sky shots. The fog driving up was
properly terrifying because visibiliy was reduced to 5 or 10 feet in
many places. But it cleared as we rose above the trees, leaving behind
a clear sky, full moon, and a valley completely filled with dense
clouds. The near foreground is red and white because I had to leave my
running lights on for safety.

And as always, the Rocky Mountain Wildlife never fails to
disappoint. They were out in force all over the park, so I finally
have a good shot of a moose as well as a molting elk looking badass.

I think I've finally struck a balance betwen the Nikon and the
Fuji. In [Scotland]({% post_url 2016-04-20-SIA %}), I kept awkardly
trying to bounce between both, and that's how I started this weekend,
too. But ultimately, I settled back to my Nikon habits for the hikes
when I could bring my lenses along. Lens changes are easier to deal
with than constantly detangling two cameras. But the Fuji went where
my Nikon would have stayed behind in the past, leaving me with only a
camera phone: the [Grand Lake Lodge](http://www.grandlakelodge.com/),
up the Zephyr lift at [Winter Park](https://www.winterparkresort.com/),
and in the airplane (because yes, sometimes I'm _that_ guy...).
